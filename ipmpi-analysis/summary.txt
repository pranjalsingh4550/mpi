Broadcast always uses binomial tree for intranode, 4 procs

alltoall always uses individual n^2 messages

internode:
	alltoall
		0-256 B - no profile
		257 onwards - individual messages
		the 0,0th entry of comm sum matrix is -1 for 70k and 60k for 30k
	
	allgather -
		recursive algorithm for 300B
		recursive for 0xffff B
		neighbour-to-neighbour for 0x10000 to 30M
	
	bcast
		scatter + recursive allgather for 0x3000 B 12kB to 0x7ffff < 512 kB -- for 8x1, 8x2, 8x4
		scatter + ring allgather for 512kB = 2^19 B -- for 8x1, 8x2, 8x4
		binomial tree for 0x2FFF
